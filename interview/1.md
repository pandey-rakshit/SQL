| ----------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1           | John Doe      | IT         | 60000  |

### Question:

You are tasked with finding the average salary for each department. Write a SQL query to achieve this, and explain the thought process behind your approach. Consider scenarios where some departments might not have any employees.

**Explanation:**

This question assesses your ability to use aggregate functions (`AVG()`), handle scenarios with no data for certain groups, and understand the importance of grouping (`GROUP BY`) in SQL queries. When solving this question, consider how to handle cases where a department has no employees and how to present the result in a clear and concise manner.
